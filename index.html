            Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

            Console is a basic computer or monitor and keyboard that is connected to another computer, server, or a mainframe over a network. It is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer.They are designed to input the operational commands and to output messages including those about equipment failures and errors. Thus, it is a "lifeline" that ensures secure access under any circumstances between console ports and components of network equipment that are part of very critical IT systems.
